# Diabetes Prediction App

## Overview
This project is a **Diabetes Prediction App** built as part of my **Data Science Engineering Course** at **Great Learning**. It marks my first attempt at using GitHub for a data science project.

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes using machine learning algorithms. The project leverages a public diabetes dataset and follows a complete data science workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data normalization.
- **Model Training:** Training various supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- **Model Evaluation:** Model performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **User Interface:** A simple front-end interface for predicting diabetes.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - Pandas (Data Manipulation)
  - NumPy (Numerical Computation)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  - Scikit-learn (ML Models & Evaluation Metrics)
  - Streamlit (Web App Deployment)

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**, which contains the following features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

The dataset was sourced from a public repository like Kaggle or the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values using imputation.
   - Standardized features using StandardScaler.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Trained models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN.
   - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Model Deployment:**
   - Deployed the final model using Streamlit.

## Future Improvements
- Add more advanced models like XGBoost.
- Improve the front-end interface.
- Use cloud platforms for deployment.
- Integrate a database for storing predictions.
